                    <p><span style="color:#000;"> #OurStateOurResponsibility</span>, an initiative of the Ministry of Information and Communications, Rivers State began on July 31, 2019
                         to mobilize those living and doing business in the State to join hands with the government to change the negative narrative about
                          Rivers State. </p>
                    <p>It is designed to make those living and doing business in the State to understand that there is a shared prosperity to protect; that
                         the prosperity of the State is the prosperity of those living in it.</p>
                    <p>It will promote the giant strides of the administration of His Excellency, Governor Nyesom Ezenwo Wike and also showcase the proud heritage 
                        of a people known for their traditional hospitality.</p>
                    <p>It is no gain saying that Rivers State being the highly acclaimed "Treasure Base of the Nation" is truly an Investor's Haven with great potentials,
                         that encourages the prosperity of small, medium and large scale businesses in it. This State is blessed with two Seaports and an international
                          airport, the headquarters of the hydrocarbon industry, contributing the highest percentage to the Nation's GDP. Amidst all these, there are negative
                           elements tagged "the vocal minority" whose stock-in-trade is to use the media to demarket the State, likening it to a hostile environment</p>

                        <p><span style="color:#000;"> #OurStateOurResponsibility</span> is a clarion call to all those that live and do business in the State, those
                         who know its true nature to start changing the negative narrative by telling our own story.</p>

                            and its interest should always come first. Political, religious and ethnic barriers should be eliminated to promote a common good.</p>

                    <h3 class="entry-title m-0">WHY IS THE CAMPAIGN IMPORTANT?</h3>
                        <p>There is a political economy to every statement being made and every perception being projected. If the State progresses, it is to the
                             advantage of all and if there is a decline, it affects all in it also. Hence, the need for all to stand and protect the interest of 
                             the State in their corners of influence.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, this campaign is going to endure for a long time. It will cause all those living and doing business in Rivers
                         State to become brand ambassadors that will continue to pass on the awareness of Rivers State being their responsibility
                          to their progeny, visitors and new dwellers in the State. Governor Nyesom Wike has shown an uncommon passion to build a
                           new Rivers State. It is time to support him through #OurStateOurResponsibility Campaign for the emergence of a greater
                            Rivers State. Let’s leave behind a worthy legacy for posterity. Let’s generate positive energy. Let’s frame the Rivers
                             State that we want not what others say. </p>
